Gradle is used to compile and test the java software. https://gradle.org/

Download and install it, I'll wait ....

To build and exercise the code:

export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gradle

gradle build

DONE!

BONUS: The shellscript wordtest.sh can be run on words.txt if you'd like to know the count of unique words in it.

Do it now.

Get to the choppa.

Cheers.
